  "readme": "mimosa-coffeescript\n===========\n\n## Overview\n\nThis is a CoffeeScript compiler for the Mimosa build tool. This module is for use with Mimosa `2.0+`.  This replicates the functionality of the CoffeeScript compiler that was built into Mimosa before `2.0`.\n\nFor more information regarding Mimosa, see http://mimosa.io\n\n## Usage\n\nAdd `'coffeescript'` to your list of modules.  That's all!  Mimosa will install the module for you when you start `mimosa watch` or `mimosa build`.\n\n## Functionality\n\nThis module will compile CoffeeScript files during `mimosa watch` and `mimosa build`.\n\nBy default, during `mimosa watch` this module will also generate source maps. Source maps map lines of compiled JavaScript back to lines of the original CoffeeScript source. So when something breaks in the compiled JavaScript, tools like the Chrome Dev Tools will show you the responsible line of CoffeeScript. Source maps are turned off by default for `mimosa build`. [Dynamic source maps](http://fitzgeraldnick.com/weblog/46/) are used by default, unless minifying code, in which case source maps are generated as separate files.\n\nCoffeeScript, by default, wraps compiled JavaScript in a safety wrapper to protect scope. This module turns this wrapping off by compiling `bare` by default. It does this because it assumes code is already being wrapped in AMD or CommonJS/AMD functions `define` or `require`.\n\nAll CoffeeScript configuration options can be provided in the `options` object, `sourceMap` and `bare` are the only ones provided values by this module.\n\nMimosa will also compile Literate CoffeeScript files if they end with the extension `litcoffee`.\n\n## Default Config\n\n```coffeescript\ncoffeescript:\n  lib: undefined\n  extensions: [\"coffee\", \"litcoffee\"]\n  sourceMapDynamic: true\n  sourceMapExclude: [/\\/specs?\\//, /_spec.js$/]\n  sourceMapConditional: false\n  options:\n    sourceMap:true\n    bare:true\n```\n\n* `lib`: You may want to use this module but may not be ready to use the latest version of CoffeeScript. Using the `lib` property you can provide a specific version of CoffeeScript if the one being used by this module isn't to your liking. To provide a specific version, you must have it `npm install`ed into your project and then provide it to `lib`. For instance: `lib: require('coffee-script')`.\n* `extensions`: an array of strings, the extensions of your CoffeeScript files.\n* `sourceMapDynamic`: a boolean, whether or not to use [Dynamic source maps](http://fitzgeraldnick.com/weblog/46/). Dynamic source maps require no extra network hops to retrieve the original source or the map files.  They are also a necessity for tools like browserify.\n* `sourceMapExclude`: an array of strings and regexes. A list of files or patterns matching files to exclude from source map generation. Strings are paths and can be either absolute or relative to `config.watch.javascriptDir`.\n* `sourceMapConditional`: a boolean, whether or not to use conditional source maps. See [this thread](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/mozilla.dev.js-sourcemap/4uo7Z5nTfUY/discussion) for details.\n* `options`: an object, the CoffeeScript compiler configuration. This object is passed straight to the CoffeeScript compiler. New properties can be added here to tweak CoffeeScript compilation.\n* `options.sourceMap`: a CoffeeScript compiler option to turn on/off source maps.\n* `options.bare`: a CoffeeScript compiler option to turn on/off the safety wrapper.\n",
